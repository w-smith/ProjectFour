Meme Locker? Vault? (Still working on the title)

This is a web app that will allow users to save their favorite images from their local computer into a personal Firebase database. Users will then be able to view and delete images from their personal 'locker' page.

I will be using Firebase for user authentication and database management. 

I will be using Angular for the front end framework (I think).
